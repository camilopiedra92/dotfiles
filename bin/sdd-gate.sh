# Puts the current repository's test suite behind a Claude Code Stop hook, as
# one commit of its own: a turn that ends on a red suite is blocked once, with
# the failure, so Claude has been shown it before the turn can end.
#
# Usage:  sdd-gate <test command> [args...]     from the repository root,
#         e.g. sdd-gate uv run pytest -q        once the project has a suite
#
# The suite runs at every stop, so the command should be one that is quick to
# run every turn; a slow suite gets a fast subset here and stays whole in CI.
#
# Why a hook: test-first otherwise rests on instructions and on the per-story
# review, and the Claude Code docs say an unattended run needs a deterministic
# gate (code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices, "Give Claude a way to verify
# its work"). Observed on Claude Code 2.1.290: a Stop hook fires and blocks
# under `claude -p` too, and the next stop of that turn arrives with
# stop_hook_active true.
#
# The hook blocks once per turn and lets the next stop through. A gate with no
# way out is the pressure under which agents edit tests to pass (ImpossibleBench,
# arXiv 2510.20270); with one, a test that cannot pass honestly gets reported.
# The hook is written into the repository rather than pointing here, so every
# clone, on any machine, runs the same gate.
#
# It runs the suite every time rather than skipping an unchanged tree. A skip
# was tried and taken out: two independent reviews found a red suite let
# through by edits it could not see (submodules, nested repositories,
# skip-worktree entries), and each fix found another.
